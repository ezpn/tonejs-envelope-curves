# Tone.js Envelope Curves Visualizer

This project is a tiny visual playground for plotting common envelope curves so they are easier to imagine and understand. It renders the curves in the browser and is meant only for visual exploration.

## What it does
- Draws envelope curves (attack/decay/release shapes) on a canvas/graph.
- Helps compare and reason about curve shapes at a glance.

## Library used
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for envelope curve definitions and related audio math utilities.
- Uses code directly from the Envelope implementation in Tone.js by Yotam Mann (Tone.js author).

## Notes
- This code is AI generated.
- The only purpose is to visualize those curves so they are easier to imagine and understand.

## Development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the dev build (per your usual workflow in this repo).
